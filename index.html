  <h1 class="headercenter">FAQ</h1>
  <h2>You're a stanger on the internet, how do I know I won't get scammed?</h2>
  <p>You don’t have to worry about that. You would pay through a stripe payment webpage and if I scam or deceive you in any way you can contact them and they will refund your payment. Stripe doesn't tolerate scammers, so I wouldn't be able to use them to accept payments if I was doing that. I also gave this tool away to a few OF creators for free in exchange for their honest testimonials. I made a subreddit specifcially for that so feel free to check it out and see the positive reviews on there. Feel free to check out the profile of each girl posting there so you can know they're from real people. The sub is r/OnlyPostTestimonials.</p>
  <h2>Will using an OnlyPost script cause my Reddit account to be deleted?</h2>
  <p>You don’t have to worry about losing your account. Your OnlyPost script is technically a bot. Reddit’s rules for bots can be seen <a href="https://www.reddit.com/wiki/bottiquette" target="_blank">here</a> and as you can see it doesn’t violate their terms of service. The only way using this script would result in you losing your account would be if you abused it and didn’t follow the posting guidelines outlined <a href="https://jchristian27.github.io/OnlyPostHowToPost/" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
