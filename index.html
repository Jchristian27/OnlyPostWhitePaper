  <h2>What Is an OnlyPost Script and What Does It Do?</h2>
    <p>An OnlyPost script is a piece of software that is customized to each user's needs that allows users to post a single photo or videoGIF to multiple (5-15) subreddits from their computer with less than a minute of active time. Such a tool allows users to make the most of their content, save time by automating the content posting process, both of which help a user to post more consistently which will in turn help them grow their audience on Reddit and their subscriber count on OF.</p>
  <h1 class="headercenter">FAQ</h1>
  <u><h2>You’re a Stranger on the Internet, How Do I Know That I Won’t Get Scammed?</h2></u>
  <p>You don’t have to worry about that. You would pay through a stripe payment webpage and if I scam or deceive you in any way you can contact them and they will refund your payment. Stripe doesn't tolerate scammers, so I wouldn't be able to use them to accept payments if I was doing that. I also gave this tool away to a few OF creators for free in exchange for their honest testimonials. I made a subreddit specifcially for that so feel free to check it out and see the positive reviews on there. Feel free to check out the profile of each girl posting there so you can know they're from real people. The sub is r/OnlyPostTestimonials.</p>
  <u><h2>Will Using an OnlyPost Script Cause My Reddit Account to Be Deleted?</h2></u>
  <p>You don’t have to worry about losing your account. Your OnlyPost script is technically a bot. Reddit’s rules for bots can be seen <a href="https://www.reddit.com/wiki/bottiquette" target="_blank">here</a> and as you can see it doesn’t violate their terms of service. The only way using this script would result in you losing your account would be if you abused it and didn’t follow the posting guidelines outlined <a href="https://jchristian27.github.io/OnlyPostHowToPost/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
  <u><h2>I’ve Heard That You Shouldn’t Post the Same Content to Multiple Subs. Why Do You Think I Should?</h2></u>
  <p>That seems to be a common opinion, but while I was doing my research prior to making the OnlyPost script I came across multiple OF girls with large followings on here and all of them posted the same content on multiple subreddits. You can see two examples of such profiles by clicking <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/cutegeekie/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/lily_alcott/" target="_blank">here</a>. Their strategy seems to be working out very well for them while also allowing them to make the most of the content they create, and a custom OnlyPost script would help you do the same.</p>
