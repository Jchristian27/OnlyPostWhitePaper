  <h1 class="headercenter">Why You Need OnlyPost</h1>
  <br>
    <u><h2>What Is OnlyPost, What Does It Do, and Why Do I Need It?</h2></u>
    <p>OnlyPost is a piece of software that is customized to each user and allows users to post a single photo or videoGIF to multiple subreddits from their computer. To make money on OnlyFans, you need subscribers. To get subscribers, you need to build an audience. If you're reading this, then you're currently building an audience on Reddit. To build an audience on Reddit, you need to post every day on multiple different subreddits. The problem with that is that posting to multiple subs on Reddit multiple every single day is monotonous and time consuming. That's where we come in. By purchasing OnlyPost, you can post a single image or videoGIF to multiple subreddits (10-15 depending on the genre of the content you're posting) with less than a minute of active time on your part. This means that you can post daily, make the most of your content, build an audience, and make more money through OnlyFans.</p>
    
    <u><h2>So if I Purchase a Custom Version of OnlyPost I Never Have to Manually Post on Reddit Again?</h2></u>
    <p>Not quite. OnlyPost should be thought of as a tool that helps you post consistently to grow your OnlyFans subscriber count rather than something that will completely eliminate the need to manually post on Reddit. OnlyPost is for posting generic content (think nude selfies, booty pics, etc.) rather than niche content (such as BDSM, blowjobs, anal, etc.) and getting as much organic engagement as possible from that generic content in order to generate interest from Reddit users so that they check out your Reddit profile and find their way to the link to your OnlyFans account. OnlyPost also makes it super easy to do this on a daily basis so that if you ever find yourself not wanting to make niche content, out of niche content, or busy on that particular day, you can still post to 10-15 subs with less than a minute of active time. This makes it so that you have no excuse to not post daily which will inevitably result in you growing your Reddit audience which will in turn cause your OnlyFans subscriber count to increase over time.</p>

    <u><h2>Will Using OnlyPost Cause My Reddit Account to Be Deleted?</h2></u>
    <p>No. OnlyPost is a Python script that is technically a Reddit bot. Reddit’s rules for bots can be seen <a href="https://www.reddit.com/wiki/bottiquette" target="_blank">here</a>. As you can see, OnlyPost doesn’t violate their terms of service since you will only be using it to automate the posting that you would already be doing manually. The only way that using OnlyPost would result in you losing your account would be if you abused it and didn’t follow the posting guidelines outlined <a href="https://jchristian27.github.io/OnlyPostHowToPost/" target="_blank">at the top of this page</a>. As long as you follow those guidelines, your account is not at risk of deletion.</p>

    <u><h2>Is My Sensitive Data at Risk When Using OnlyPost?</h2></u>
    <p>No. The process of setting up OnlyPost is done entirely on your computer from start to finish so that everything runs through your computer and your computer alone. We will have zero access to any of your passwords, photos, videoGIFs, etc. While this makes the setup process a bit more complicated than it would be if we did everything for you, it prioritizes your privacy which is something we strongly believe in.</p>

    <u><h2>I’ve Heard That You Shouldn’t Post the Same Content to Multiple Subs. Why Do You Think I Should?</h2></u>
    <p>That seems to be a common opinion, but while we were doing our research prior to building OnlyPost we came across a plethora of OnlyFans creators with large followings on Reddit and nearly all of them posted the same pieces of content to multiple subreddits. You can see an example of such a profile by clicking <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/lily_alcott/" target="_blank">here</a>. This woman's strategy seems to be working out very well for her while also allowing her to make the most of the content she creates. OnlyPost would help you do the same thing with the additional benefit of also saving you time every day.</p>

    <u><h2>So How Exactly Does OnlyPost Work??</h2></u>
    <p>OnlyPost works through the Terminal on your MacBook or iMac. If you are unfamiliar with what a Terminal is, no worries. It is extremely easy to use and we will walk you through how to use it in our setup instructions if you decide to purchase OnlyPost. If you can type something into Google then you can use a Terminal. All you have to do is open a Terminal window, type <code>post</code>, hit enter, type out the caption of your image or videoGIF, hit enter, paste the URL of your photo or videoGIF from RedGIFs into the terminal, hit enter, select what genre the piece of content you're about to post falls under (i.e. what the main focus of photo/videoGIF you're about to post is -- ass, boobs, pussy, or asshole), and hit enter. That's it. This whole process takes less than a minute and OnlyPost will post your image or videoGIF to the subreddits of your choosing (that you select through an intake form) while you go about the rest of your day. If you would like to see this in action, you can watch a video of this process <a href="https://jchristian27.github.io/OnlyPostHowToPost/" target="_blank">at the bottom of this page</a>.</p>

    <u><h2>How Does the Intake Form You Mentioned Above Work?</h2></u>
    <p>Once we receive your payment via Stripe we will send you a link to an intake form. This intake form covers subreddits pertaining to ass related content (pawg, big asses, smaller asses, etc) and general subreddits relevant to you for all types of content (ethnicity, age range, body composition, etc). You will fill out the form by selecting the subreddits most relevant to you and your content and we will use this information to customize OnlyPost to post content to subreddits that best fit you. Subreddits for pussy, boob, and asshole related content have already been selected by us due to a lack of variety in subreddits focusing on that content. A few additional subreddits will also be posted to regardless of the genre of content being posted as they are solid subreddits that have a good following and accept a broad array of OnlyFans related content. By having a mixture of subreddits specifically selected by you to best reflect you and your content and subreddits selected by us to best expand the reach of your content, you will be in an optimized and strategic position to post your content to relevant subs while also reaching new potential OnlyFans subscribers at the same time.</p>

    <u><h2>What Does the Setup Process for OnlyPost Look Like?</h2></u>
    <p>The process is simple and should only take you about 15 minutes to complete from start to finish. If you can copy and paste things and click on links, then you can setup OnlyPost. If you'd like to see our setup instructions in full, <a href="https://jchristian27.github.io/OnlyPostSetupInstructions/" target="_blank">click here</a>.</p>

    <u><h2>What Type of Content Should I Post With OnlyPost?</h2></u>
    <p>Because so many subs have their own various rules, we recommend that you stick to posting softcore/solo content with OnlyPost. Hardcore material and/or material with partners is usually better suited for more niche subs, so such content should be posted manually to those kinds of subs. Posting hardcore content and/or content that isn't allowed on a sub may result in you getting banned from that sub which is a situation we want you to avoid.</p>

    <u><h2>Who Created OnlyPost?</h2></u> 
    <p>OnlyPost was created by u/justanotherperson297 and u/Tight-Masterpiece96. We are both freelance Python programmers that are passionate about creating tools that help people make the most of their time. Essentially, we are just like you. We just want to make enough money to get by and enjoy our lives while doing work we enjoy.</p> 
    
    <u><h2>How Much Does OnlyPost Cost?</h2></u>
    <p>A custom version of OnlyPost is $150. We know that that's a lot of money, but it will pay for itself within a few months. If you value your time at $10 an hour (less than minimum wage where we live), post 15 times per day, and take a minute to get each post up, OnlyPost will save you 7.5 hours of your time each month (which is $75 of your time at $10 per hour) and pay for itself within two months. If you value your time at more than $10 per hour, it will pay for itself even sooner. If it helps you acquire new OnlyFans subscribers (which it will), it will generate money for you on top of the time it saves you. It's an investment in yourself and your OnlyFans business that will save you time, make the most of your content, and make you more money.</p>
    
    <u><h2>You’re Just Strangers on the Internet. How Do I Know That I Won’t Get Scammed?</h2></u>
    <p>You don’t have to worry about that. If you decide to purchase a custom version of OnlyPost from us, you'll pay via Stripe. If we scam or deceive you in any way, you can contact Stripe and they will refund you your payment. Stripe doesn't tolerate scammers, so we wouldn't be able to use them to accept payments if we were in the scamming business. We also gave this tool away to a few OnlyFans creators for free in exchange for their honest testimonials. We made a subreddit specifically for these testimonials, so feel free to check it out and read the reviews on there. Take the time to check out the profiles of each girl who has posted there so that you can see that they're real people just like you. The sub is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OnlyPostTestimonials/" target="_blank">r/OnlyPostTestimonials</a>.</p>
