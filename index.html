  <h1 class="headercenter">Why You Need OnlyPost</h1>
  <br>
    <u><h2>What Is OnlyPost, What Does It Do, and Why Do I Need It?</h2></u>
    <p>OnlyPost is a piece of software that is customized to each user and allows users to post a single photo or videoGIF to multiple subreddits from their computer. To make money on OnlyFans, you need subscribers. To get subscribers, you need to build an audience. If you're reading this, then you're currently building an audience on Reddit. To build an audience on Reddit, you need to post multiple times per day on multiple different subreddits. The problem with that is that posting on Reddit multiple times per day every day is boring and time consuming. That's where we come in. By purchasing a OnlyPost, you can post a single image or videoGIF to multiple subreddits (10-20 depending on the genre of the content your posting) with less than a minute of active time on your part. This means that you can post daily, make the most of your content, build an audience, and make more money through OnlyFans.</p>
    
    <u><h2>How Does OnlyPost Work?</h2></u>
    <p>OnlyPost works through the Terminal on your MacBook or iMac. All you do is open your terminal, type <code>post</code>, hit enter, type out the caption of your image or videoGIF, drag an drop an image or videoGIF from your computer into the terminal, select what genre the piece of content you're about to post falls under (ass, boobs, pussy, or asshole), and hit enter. This whole process takes less than a minute and OnlyPost will post your image or videoGIF to the subreddits of your choosing (that you select through an intake form) while you go about your day. You can watch a video of this process <a href="https://jchristian27.github.io/OnlyPostHowToPost/" target="_blank">at the bottom of this page</a>.</p>

    <u><h2>Who Created OnlyPost?</h2></u> 
    <p>OnlyPost was created by u/justanotherperson297 and u/Tight-Masterpiece96. We are both freelance Python programmers that are passionate about creating tools that help people make the most of their time. Essentially, we are just like you. We just want to make enough money to get by and enjoy our lives while doing work we enjoy.</p> 
    
    <u><h2>How Much Does It Cost?</h2></u>
    <p>A custom version of OnlyPost is $150. We know that that's a lot of money, but it will pay for itself within a few months. If you value your time at $10 an hour (less than minimum wage where we live), post 15 times per day, and take a minute to get each post up, OnlyPost will save you 7.5 hours of your time each month (which is $75 of your time at $10 per hour) and pay for itself within two months. If you value your time at more than $10 per hour, it will pay for itself even sooner. If it helps you acquire new OnlyFans subscribers (which it will), it will generate money for you on top of the time it saves you. It's an investment in yourself and your OnlyFans business that will save you time, make the most of your content, and make you more money.</p>
    
    <u><h2>You’re a Stranger on the Internet. How Do I Know That I Won’t Get Scammed?</h2></u>
    <p>You don’t have to worry about that. If you decided to purchase a custom version of OnlyPost from us, you'll pay via Stripe. If we scam or deceive you in any way, you can contact Stripe and they will refund you your payment. Stripe doesn't tolerate scammers, so we wouldn't be able to use them to accept payments if we were in the scamming business. We also gave this tool away to a few OnlyFans creators for free in exchange for their honest testimonials. We made a subreddit specifcially for these testimonials, so feel free to check it out and read the reviews on there. Take the time to check out the profiles of each girl who has posted there so that you can see that they're real people just like you. The sub is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OnlyPostTestimonials/" target="_blank">r/OnlyPostTestimonials</a>.</p>
   
    <u><h2>Will Using OnlyPost Cause My Reddit Account to Be Deleted?</h2></u>
    <p>You don’t have to worry about your account getting deleted. OnlyPost is a Python script that is technically a Reddit bot. Reddit’s rules for bots can be seen <a href="https://www.reddit.com/wiki/bottiquette" target="_blank">here</a>. As you can see, OnlyPost doesn’t violate their terms of service since you will only be using it to automate the posting that you would already be doing manually. The only way that using OnlyPost would result in you losing your account would be if you abused it and didn’t follow the posting guidelines outlined <a href="https://jchristian27.github.io/OnlyPostHowToPost/" target="_blank">at the top of this page</a>. As long as you follow those guidlines, you account is not at risk of deletion.</p>
    
    <u><h2>I’ve Heard That You Shouldn’t Post the Same Content to Multiple Subs. Why Do You Think I Should?</h2></u>
    <p>That seems to be a common opinion, but while we were doing our research prior to building OnlyPost we came across a plethora of OnlyFans creators with large followings on Reddit and nearly all of them posted the same piece of content to multiple subreddits. You can see two examples of such profiles by clicking <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/cutegeekie/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/lily_alcott/" target="_blank">here</a>. Their strategy seems to be working out very well for them while also allowing them to make the most of the content they create. OnlyPost would help you do the same thing while also saving you time every day.</p>
