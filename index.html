  <h1 class="headercenter">Why You Need an OnlyPost Script</h1>
  <br>
    <u><h2>What Is an OnlyPost Script and What Does It Do?</h2></u>
      <p>An OnlyPost script is a piece of software that is customized to each user's needs that allows users to post a single photo or videoGIF to multiple subreddits (around 10-20 depending on what genre of content you are posting) from their computer with less than a minute of active time. Such a tool allows users to make the most of their content, save time by automating the content posting process, both of which help a user to post more consistently which will in turn help them grow their audience on Reddit and their subscriber count on OF.</p>
    <u><h2>Why Do I Need It?</h2></u>
      <p>To make money on OnlyFans, you need subscribers. To get subscribers, you need to build an audience. If you're reading this, then you are building an audience on Reddit. To build an audience on Reddit, you need to post multiple times per day on multiple different subreddits. The problem with that is that posting on Reddit multiple times per day every day is boring and time consuming. That's where we come in. By purchasing a custom OnlyPost script, you can post a single image or videoGIF to multiple subreddits (10-20 depending on the genre of the content your posting) with less than a minute of active time on your part. This means that you can post daily, make the most of your content, build an audience, and make more money through OnlyFans.</p>
    <u><h2>Who Created OnlyPost?</h2></u> 
      <p>OnlyPost was created by u/justanotherperson297 and u/Tight-Masterpiece96. We are both freelance Python programmers that are passionate about creating tools that help people make the most of their time. Essentially, we are just like you. We just want to make enough money to get by and enjoy our lives while doing work we enjoy.</p> 
    <u><h2>How Much Does It Cost?</h2></u>
      <p>A custom OnlyPost script is $150. That's a small price to pay to make the most of your content, never bother with manually posting multiple times a day, and growing your Reddit audience and OF subscriber count.</p>
    <u><h2>You’re a Stranger on the Internet, How Do I Know That I Won’t Get Scammed?</h2></u>
      <p>You don’t have to worry about that. You would pay through a stripe payment webpage and if I scam or deceive you in any way you can contact them and they will refund your payment. Stripe doesn't tolerate scammers, so I wouldn't be able to use them to accept payments if I was doing that. I also gave this tool away to a few OF creators for free in exchange for their honest testimonials. I made a subreddit specifcially for that so feel free to check it out and see the positive reviews on there. Feel free to check out the profile of each girl posting there so you can know they're from real people. The sub is r/OnlyPostTestimonials.</p>
    <u><h2>Will Using an OnlyPost Script Cause My Reddit Account to Be Deleted?</h2></u>
      <p>You don’t have to worry about losing your account. Your OnlyPost script is technically a bot. Reddit’s rules for bots can be seen <a href="https://www.reddit.com/wiki/bottiquette" target="_blank">here</a> and as you can see it doesn’t violate their terms of service. The only way using this script would result in you losing your account would be if you abused it and didn’t follow the posting guidelines outlined <a href="https://jchristian27.github.io/OnlyPostHowToPost/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
    <u><h2>I’ve Heard That You Shouldn’t Post the Same Content to Multiple Subs. Why Do You Think I Should?</h2></u>
      <p>That seems to be a common opinion, but while I was doing my research prior to making the OnlyPost script I came across multiple OF girls with large followings on here and all of them posted the same content on multiple subreddits. You can see two examples of such profiles by clicking <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/cutegeekie/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/lily_alcott/" target="_blank">here</a>. Their strategy seems to be working out very well for them while also allowing them to make the most of the content they create, and a custom OnlyPost script would help you do the same.</p>
